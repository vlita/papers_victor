@article{Boguslawski2015OrbtitalEntanglement,
	abstract = {The basic concepts of orbital entanglement and its application to chemistry are briefly reviewed. The calculation of orbital entanglement measures from correlated wavefunctions is discussed in terms of reduced n-particle density matrices. Possible simplifications in their evaluation are highlighted in case of seniority-zero wavefunctions. Specifically, orbital entanglement allows us to dissect electron correlation effects in its strong and weak contributions, to determine bond orders, to assess the quality and stability of active space calculations, to monitor chemical reactions, and to identify points along the reaction coordinate where electronic wavefunctions change drastically. Thus, orbital entanglement represents a useful and intuitive tool to interpret complex electronic wavefunctions and to facilitate a qualitative understanding of electronic structure and how it changes in chemical processes. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Luzanov2005IrreducibleCharge,
	abstract = {Abstract A novel procedure for deriving multicenter bond indices on the basis of irreducible spinless charge density matrices that are naturally introduced as in the Ursell--Mayer theory is presented. Unlike earlier schemes using central moments of the charge operator, the procedure presented here leads to a proper definition of multicenter bond indices for an arbitrary number of atoms. Formal relationships and numerical techniques for the typical configuration interaction (CI) approaches, up to full CI, are given and illustrated with simple molecular systems. Comparison of the molecular orbital and full CI results indicates strong electron correlation effects, especially for the 3-center and 4-center bond indices. Excited state multicenter bond indices are described within the CI singles approach. The problem of proper definition of atomic valence and bond indices for electronic states with nonzero spin is raised. {\copyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Int J Quantum Chem, 2005},

@article{Ziesche1995CorrelationStrength,
	abstract = {Abstract The correlation present in the nondegenerate ground state of an interacting Fermi system is discussed in terms of reduced density matrices and their cumulant expansion. By generalizing a result obtained for the interacting uniform electron gas (correlation induced exchange-hole narrowing), possible measures of the correlation strength in terms of natural occupation numbers (the eigenvalues of the true one-particle density matrix) are introduced. These quantities-the v-order nonidempotency and the information entropy of the natural occupation numbers-result from the correlated many-body wave function and characterize the ground-state correlation in addition to the usual correlation energy. The uniform electron gas serves as a first illustrative example. {\copyright} 1995 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Inc.},

@article{Lee1989TheoreticaInvestigations,
	abstract = {The deficiencies of common ab initio methods for the reliable prediction of the equilibrium structures of compounds composed of only the fluorine, oxygen and nitrogen atoms are investigated. Specifically, the importance of using large one-particle basis sets with multiple sets of polarization functions has been studied. Additionally, the need for a set of f basis functions was investigated. Several different single reference electron correlation methods have been tested in order to determine whether it is possible for a single reference based method to be routinely used on such chemical systems. These electron correlation methods include second order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), singles and doubles configuration interaction (CISD), the coupled pair functional (CPF) approach and singles and doubles coupled cluster (CCSD) theory. The molecular systems studied include difluoroperoxide (FOOF), the cis form of the NO dimer, cis and trans difluorodiazene (FNNF) and the transition state to interconversion of the cis and trans isomers of FNNF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the cis-trans isomerization transition state has been reported. At the highest level of theory employed, the equilibrium structures of cis and trans FNNF agree very well with the experimental structures. However, the barrier to interconversion is predicted to be 65 kcal/mole, which is substantially higher than the experimental activation energy of 32 kcal/mole. Potential sources of error are discussed. A new diagnostic method for determining a priori the reliability of single reference based electron correlation methods is suggested and discussed.},

@article{Buenker1974IndividualizedConfiguration,
	abstract = {A configuration selection method for CI calculations is discussed and applied in which the energy lowering produced in a secular equation by the addition of a given test species to a series of dominant configurations is used as an ordering parameter. Configurations with energy lowerings below a given energy cut-off value are not included in the final secular equations but instead a method of estimating the combined effect of the neglected species on the corresponding non-selected CI results is developed. The influence of the choice of main configurations used in the selection process is given close examination as well as the importance of the MO basis employed in the treatment as a whole; in the latter case a non-iterative procedure for obtaining approximate natural orbitals for such calculations is suggested. The resulting configuration selection procedure is equally applicable to all types of electronic states in any nuclear geometry and the results of the associated CI calculations are seen to be essentially equivalent to a complete treatment in which all single- and double-excitation species with respect to aseries of dominant configurations in a given state are included.},

@article{Evenbly2011TensorNetwork,
	abstract = {Tensor network states are used to approximate ground states of local Hamiltonians on a lattice in D spatial dimensions. Different types of tensor network states can be seen to generate different geometries. Matrix product states (MPS) in D=1 dimensions, as well as projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in D&gt;1 dimensions, reproduce the D-dimensional physical geometry of the lattice model; in contrast, the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) generates a (D+1)-dimensional holographic geometry. Here we focus on homogeneous tensor networks, where all the tensors in the network are copies of the same tensor, and argue that certain structural properties of the resulting many-body states are preconditioned by the geometry of the tensor network and are therefore largely independent of the choice of variational parameters. Indeed, the asymptotic decay of correlations in homogeneous MPS and MERA for D=1 systems is seen to be determined by the structure of geodesics in the physical and holographic geometries, respectively; whereas the asymptotic scaling of entanglement entropy is seen to always obey a simple boundary law---that is, again in the relevant geometry. This geometrical interpretation offers a simple and unifying framework to understand the structural properties of, and helps clarify the relation between, different tensor network states. In addition, it has recently motivated the branching MERA, a generalization of the MERA capable of reproducing violations of the entropic boundary law in D&gt;1 dimensions.},

@article{Chan2012LowEntanglement,
	abstract = {Abstract We review a class of efficient wavefunction approximations that are based around the limit of low entanglement. These wavefunctions, which go by such names as matrix product states and tensor network states, occupy a different region of Hilbert space from wavefunctions built around the Hartree--Fock limit. The best known class of low entanglement wavefunctions, the matrix product states, forms the variational space of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Because of their different structure to many other quantum chemistry wavefunctions, low entanglement approximations hold promise for problems conventionally considered hard in quantum chemistry, and in particular problems which have a multireference or strong correlation nature. In this review, we describe low entanglement wavefunctions at an introductory level, focusing on the main theoretical ideas. Topics covered include the theory of efficient wavefunction approximations, entanglement, matrix product states, and tensor network states including the tree tensor network, projected entangled pair states, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz. {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.
